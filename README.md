# Support vector machines (SVM)
## Introduction
Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or 
regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems.

This repository contains the implementation of SVM algorithm from scratch in python and also using sklearn library.

## Scripts
* In the [main.py](main.py) file, you can find the training, testing and comparison of the SVMs 
using the sklearn library, from scratch and with a classical and quantum kernel.
* In the [kernels.py](kernels.py) file, you can find the implementation of the classical and quantum kernels.
* In the [scratch.py](scratch.py) file, you can find the implementation of the SVM algorithm from scratch.
* In the [visualization.py](visualization.py) file, you can find the implementation of the visualization of the
decision boundary of the SVMs.



Note: This repository is currently under construction. More details will be added soon.
